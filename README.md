## About this project

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS

### What I learned

- To better specify the effects of properties in elements.
- That when adding multiple sources for an image, you can do it based on either the viewport or media queries, the 'picture' element gives you more control and works better with this design where different images need to be displayed depending on the device.
- To use media queries and set dimensions based on viewport.

### Useful resources

- [Chat Gpt](https://chat.openai.com/) - Very interesting and useful tool. The GPT-3 works well as a comprehensive guide for properties and elements.

## Final Notes

I'm really pleased with the final result of the project, specially with the responsiveness of the layout, it was my first project with an adaptable layout so this was completely unfamiliar territory. It was really challenging but i beat it and it turned out exactly as i wanted, except for some issues between 501-610px width but it's okay, when I find a way to fix it, I'll update the code (fixed and updated). I had fun assembling this puzzle and learned a lot in the process.
